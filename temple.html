<p><span style="font-weight: bold;color: black;">🕉️ Hanumandhara Temple, Sihor:</span>

Nestled near the ancient Brahma Kund and on the slopes of the Satsherdi/Liliyo hills, the Hanumandhara Temple is a cherished spiritual site in Sihor, dedicated to Lord Hanuman and often associated with Ambaji or Amba worship 

 Built centuries ago by the local community, the temple is a notable example of collective devotional effort, evidenced by the natural rock outcrops and hand-built shrine complex integrated into the hill’s terrain .

The temple is frequented by devotees, especially on Tuesdays and Saturdays, which are considered auspicious for Hanumanji worship. These days see large gatherings and special aartis held in the evenings. The site is also connected with local folklore and healing traditions—its proximity to Brahma Kund with its reputed medicinal waters draws pilgrims seeking blessings and relief .

What makes Hanumandhara distinctive is its open-air structure amid rocky outcrops, creating a serene natural ambiance. It also forms part of the broader Navnath pilgrimage circuit in Sihor, blending spiritual reverence with light trekking 

A visit combines the thrill of hill-side exploration with heartfelt devotion to Hanumanji.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;color: black;">Khodiyar Mata Mandir (Rajpara)</span>
Situated just a few kilometers from Sihor on the Bhavnagar–Rajkot highway (at Rajpara village), the Khodiyar Mata Mandir is one of Gujarat’s most revered temples. Dedicated to Khodiyar Maa, a warrior goddess of the Charan caste believed to have manifested around 700 AD, it holds deep cultural significance 
 The current grand structure was built under the patronage of Bhavnagar royalty—initially revered by Maharaja Wakhatsinghji Gohil, who invited the goddess to follow him to Sihor but turned back near Rajpara, thus marking the temple’s location 
 The temple you see today was constructed in 1911 by Maharaja Krishnakumarsinhji, featuring a lakeside mandap, well-maintained gardens, and facilities such as ropeways, guest houses, and a dharmashala 
 Known for its serene atmosphere by Tataniya Wali Lake, the mandir draws devotees especially on Tuesdays, Sundays, and Purnima, along with large crowds during Navratri and festival seasons 
 It includes free prasad (like lapsi) and meals, medical services, and a temple trust established in 1953 to oversee its operations 
 The accessible location (about 6 km from Sihor station, 22 km from Bhavnagar airport) makes it easy for pilgrims to visit
